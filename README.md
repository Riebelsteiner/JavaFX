# JavaFX
JavaFX Sample Classes:
Four Java classes that solve access to resource files.  
It is specifically for FXML-, css-, image-files and generally for objects like File objects for which an URL is required.   
The access works for applications running in Eclipse or started by cmdline from class files, from jar files or from a jlinked custom JRE.  
The application can be modular. The calling class and the resource file can be in different modules.  
The Solution is tested under Windows 10 but should also run under other OS.  
It is one code for all these cases and although it covers all these cases, there are less than ten real code lines. 
The most lines are for javadoc and describe how to call the class and other hints.
